\usage{
catchMSYModel(sID, selex = FALSE, nlSearch = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sID}{Stock ID object}

\item{selex}{Boolean flag to turn off search across sel50 parameter. 
Set to TRUE when including the prior on sel50.}

\item{nlSearch}{Boolean flag to turn off non-statistical criterion for 
non-linear search. Set to TRUE when using non-linear search routines.}
}
\description{
An age-structured assessment model paramterized using MSY and FMSY  
as the leading parameters, and the instantaneous natural mortality  rate. This function generates biomass estimates, estimates of fishing mortality rates, and stock depletion.  It also returns statistical criterion depending on the available data, and non-statistical criterion based on satisfying user specified constraints.
}
\details{
The age-structured model is conditioned on the historical catch data 
(in weight).  The catch equation assumes that both
fishing mortality and natural mortality are occuring simultaneously, and the
instantaneous fishing mortality rate is found by solving the Baranov catch 
equation \eqn{C =  F/Z*(1-exp(-Z))*B}, for \code{F}.
