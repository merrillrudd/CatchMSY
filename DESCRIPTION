Description: This package contains several scripts and routines for conducting
    fisheries stock assessment based on the simple Catch-MSY method
    developed by  Martell and Froese (2012). Updated from the simple Catch-MSY method, the method now has an underlying age-structured model, can integrate an abundance index, biomass survey, mean length time series, and/or length composition data, and estimates management-oriented parameters (MSY and Fmsy instead of Schaefer r and K).
